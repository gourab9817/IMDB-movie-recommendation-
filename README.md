# IMDB-movie-recommendation-
Discover your next movie! This recommender system (Python, Pandas, scikit-learn) suggests similar films based on cast, crew, genre &amp; sequels (IMDB 5000 data incl.). UI with Tailwind CSS. Run in Google Colab &amp; find your cinematic match!

This project implements a movie recommendation system using the IMDB 5000 Movies dataset (included in this repository). It recommends six similar movies based on your chosen film, considering factors like:

Actor cast and crew
Director
Movie similarity (genre, theme, etc.)
Part 1, Part 2, etc. relationships (sequels/prequels)
Features:

Leverages Python libraries like Pandas, scikit-learn, and others for data analysis and recommendation algorithms.
Employs Google Colab for cloud-based development and execution.
Provides a basic user interface (UI) built with HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), for a user-friendly experience.
Installation:

Clone the repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/gourab9817/IMDB-movie-recommendation.git
Use code with caution.
Install dependencies (if not already installed):

Bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn [other required libraries]
Use code with caution.
Replace [other required libraries] with any additional dependencies specific to your project. Consider creating a requirements.txt file to manage dependencies more efficiently.

Usage:

Run the Jupyter Notebook (or Python script):

Locate the main script or Jupyter Notebook file (e.g., main.ipynb or app.py).
Open it in Google Colab or a local Jupyter Notebook environment.
Follow the instructions within the code to provide movie input and interact with the recommendation system.
(Optional) Deploy the UI:

If you've built a separate UI component, follow the deployment instructions specific to your framework/server setup. This might involve building the UI using Tailwind CSS, and serving it with a web server (e.g., Flask, Django).

Data:

The project utilizes the IMDB 5000 Movies dataset, which is included in the data directory of this repository.
Libraries:

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms for recommendations (e.g., cosine similarity, collaborative filtering).
